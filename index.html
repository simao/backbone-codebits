<!-- Backbone supplies structure to JavaScript-heavy applications by
providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections
with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event
handling, and connects it all to your existing application over a
RESTful JSON interface.

Different implementations of the Model-View-Controller pattern tend to
disagree about the definition of a controller. If it helps any, in
Backbone, the View class can also be thought of as a kind of
controller, dispatching events that originate from the UI, with the
HTML template serving as the true view. We call it a View because it
represents a logical chunk of UI, responsible for the contents of a
single DOM element.

Backbone.Model – Like a Rails model minus the class methods. Wraps a row of data in business logic.
Backbone.Collection – A group of models on the client-side, with sorting/filtering/aggregation logic.
Backbone.Router – Rails routes.rb + Rails controller actions. Maps URLs to functions.
Backbone.View – A logical, re-usable piece of UI. Often, but not always, associated with a model.
Client-side Templates – Rails .html.erb views, rendering a chunk of HTML.

  <h2>Enter Backbone JS</h2>

  <h3>Not your Rails/Django/... MVC</h3>

  <p>Backbone supplies <strong>structure</strong> to web applications by providing
    <strong>Models, Collections, Views and Events</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Backbone.Model</strong> Like a Rails/Django model, wraps data with business logic</li>
    <li><strong>Backbone.View</strong> A re-usable piece of UI, often associated with a model. Dispatches events that originate from the UI</li>
    <li><strong>Backbone.Collection</strong> A group of models on the client-side</li>
    <li><strong>Templates</strong> Like Rails .html.erb views or Django templates
  </ul>
  
  <p>All connected with key-value binding, custom events and
  declarative event handling</p>

  <h3>Where's the controller?</h3>
  <p>Backbone uses <strong>Backbone.Router</strong> to map urls and hashes to functions</p>

<section class="slide" id="models">
  <h2>Backbone.Model</h2>

  <p>Models contain the web app data and a big part of it's logic:
conversions, validations, computed properties, etc</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Powerful wrapper around a JSON object</li>
    <li>Like a traditional Model, but with a simpler API</li>
    <li>Event binding support for many different event types,
    (e.g. change of an attribute, refresh, etc...)</li>
    <li>Able to sync with a server site RESTful JSON API</li>
    <ul>
      <li>But you don't need a RESTful API</li>
      <!-- <li>You can save your models using localStorage or in
      memory</li> -->
    </ul>
    <li>Extend Backbone.Model with your domain-specific methods</li>
  </ul>

<!-- TODO: Code for Models -->


<!-- Collections are ordered sets of models. You can to bind "change"
events to be notified when any model in the collection has been
modified, listen for "add" and "remove" events, fetch the collection
from the server, and use a full suite of Underscore.js methods.

Any event that is triggered on a model in a collection will also be
triggered on the collection directly, for convenience. This allows you
to listen for changes to specific attributes in any model in a
collection, for example: Documents.bind("change:selected", ...)
-->

<section class="slide" id="collections">
  <h2>Backbone.Collection</h2>

  <p>An object containing many instances of a model class</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Can update itself using via AJAX using a simple method call</li>
    <li>Allows event binding to change events on any model in the collection</li>
    <li>Supports most Underscore JS array functions, inspired by Ruby's Enumerable methods</li>

    Coisas para falar:

Views — they don't determine anything about your HTML or CSS for you,
and can be used with any JavaScript templating library. The general
idea is to organize your interface into logical views, backed by
models, each of which can be updated independently when the model
changes, without having to redraw the page. Instead of digging into a
JSON object, looking up an element in the DOM, and updating the HTML
by hand, you can bind your view's render function to the model's
"change" event — and now everywhere that model data is displayed in
the UI, it is always immediately up to date.
-->


<section class="slide" id="views">
  <h2>Backbone.Views</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>They don't determine anything about your HTML, that's the template's job</li>
    <li>They glue the model with the template</li>
    <li>The idea is to organize the interface into logical views,

<!-- 
Events is a module that can be mixed in to any object, giving the
object the ability to bind and trigger custom named events. Events do
not have to be declared before they are bound, and may take passed
arguments. For example:
-->

<section class="slide" id="events">
  <h2>Backbone.Events</h2>

  <p>Can be mixed in to any object</p>

  <ul> 
    <li>Simple, yet powerful API to handle events</li>
    <li>Gives object the ability to bind and trigger custom named events.</li>   
  </ul>

  <pre>
    var object = {};
    _.extend(object, Backbone.Events);
    object.bind("alert", function(msg) {
    	alert("Triggered " + msg);
    });

    object.trigger("alert", "an event");
  </pre>

<h3>Backbone is great</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Good documentation</li>
