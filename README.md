# Give a Backbone to your web Applications

These are the slides for a talk I gave on backbone.js

The slides require the included python http server to be running in
the background so the JavaScript examples can work properly and
actually show a real timeline.

You can see a running version of these slides at

## Talk Abstract

If you have ever written a Javascript Web Application, you know how
chaotic your code can get. If you are not careful, you'll get a nice
and warm spaghetti code base without anything resembling a good
structure. Your data will be completely coupled with your presentation
and you'll end up swearing not to write any JavaScript again. For
life. Until you find a client side MVC framework.

On the
[Backbone.js website](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/), you
can read:

    Backbone supplies structure to JavaScript-heavy applications by
    providing models with key-value binding and custom events,
    collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with
    declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing
    application over a RESTful JSON interface.

In this presentation I will show you what backbone.js is, why you will
want to use it and how to start using it. I will walk you through a
real example so you can start using backbone.js in no time!
